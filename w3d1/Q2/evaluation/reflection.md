# Reflection

## Impact of Tree-of-Thought + Self-Consistency
- Helped explore multiple paths and reduce overconfidence in one-shot answers.
- Majority voting worked well for math/logical questions.

## Prompt Optimization
- Iterative refinement led to more structured breakdowns in reasoning.
- Trade-off: increased complexity in prompt engineering, longer execution.

## Trade-offs
- Cost: Higher for multiple paths.
- Complexity: More components and logging.
- Quality: Better coherence and accuracy with thoughtful prompting.
